# Primer Fusion: Enterprise Last-Mile Connector

### A High-Fidelity Prototype Demonstrating Quantifiable Business Impact

Primer Fusion is a functional prototype of a Microsoft Word Add-in designed to solve the "Two-Desktop Problem" for intelligence analysts. It directly embeds Primer's trusted AI platform into the analyst's primary deliverable environment, eliminating manual, error-prone workflows and creating significant product stickiness.

This prototype was engineered not just to demonstrate a feature, but to prove a business case: deep workflow integration is a primary driver of churn reduction.

## 📈 The Business Impact: Why This Matters

This MVP directly addresses a critical business metric: **customer retention**. By embedding Primer into a mission-critical, "last-mile" workflow, the platform becomes indispensable, creating high switching costs. Industry data from authoritative sources like ProfitWell and Crossbeam quantifies this impact:

* **58% Churn Rate Reduction:** Customers using deep product integrations are, on average, 58% less likely to churn. This MVP is a direct path to realizing that retention gain.
* **22% Retention Rate Improvement:** Products with even one critical integration see a 10-22% higher retention rate. Fusion acts as this anchor integration within the analyst's most crucial tool: Microsoft Word.
* **30% Higher Willingness to Pay:** Deeply integrated products command a 20-30% higher willingness to pay, directly increasing customer lifetime value by solving a painful, final-step problem.
